= Introduction
//In the title of concept modules, include nouns or noun phrases that are used in the body text. This helps readers and search engines find the information quickly.
//Do not start the title of concept modules with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

A short introductory paragraph is required for the concept module.
It will provide an overview of the module.

The contents of a concept module give the user descriptions and explanations needed to understand and use a product.

* Look at nouns and noun phrases in related procedure modules and assemblies to find the concepts to explain to users.
* Explain only things that are visible to users. Even if a concept is interesting, it probably does not require explanation if it is not visible to users.
* Do not include any instructions to perform an action, such as executing a command. Action items belong in procedure modules.

.Additional resources

* A bulleted list of links to other material closely related to the contents of the concept module.
* For more details on writing concept modules, see the link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].
* Use a consistent system for file names, IDs, and titles. For tips, see _Anchor Names and File Names_ in link:https://github.com/redhat-documentation/modular-docs#modular-documentation-reference-guide[Modular Documentation Reference Guide].

[id="builds-about_{context}"]
= Builds

A _build_ is the process of transforming input parameters into a resulting
object. Most often, the process is used to transform input parameters or source
code into a runnable image. A `BuildConfig` object is the definition of the
entire build process.

{product-title} uses Kubernetes by creating containers
from build images and pushing them to a container image registry.

Build objects share common characteristics including inputs for a build, the requirement to
complete a build process, logging the build process, publishing resources from
successful builds, and publishing the final status of the build. Builds take
advantage of resource restrictions, specifying limitations on resources such as
CPU usage, memory usage, and build or pod execution time.




The resulting object of a build depends on the builder used to create it. For
Docker and S2I builds, the resulting objects are runnable images. For Custom
builds, the resulting objects are whatever the builder image author has
specified.

Additionally, the Pipeline build strategy can be used to implement sophisticated
workflows:

* Continuous integration
* Continuous deployment

[id="builds-strategy-docker-build_{context}"]
= Docker build

The Docker build strategy invokes the docker build command, and it expects a
repository with a *_Dockerfile_* and all required artifacts in it to produce a
runnable image.

[id="build-strategy-s2i_{context}"]
= Source-to-Image (S2I) build

Source-to-Image (S2I) is a tool for building reproducible, Docker-formatted
container images. It produces ready-to-run images by injecting application
source into a container image and assembling a new image. The new image
incorporates the base image (the builder) and built source and is ready to use
with the `buildah run` command. S2I supports incremental builds, which re-use
previously downloaded dependencies, previously built artifacts, etc.

The advantages of S2I include the following:

[horizontal]
Image flexibility:: S2I scripts can be written to inject
application code into almost any existing Docker-formatted container image,
taking advantage of the existing ecosystem. Note that, currently, S2I relies on
`tar` to inject application source, so the image needs to be able to process
tarred content.

Speed:: With S2I, the assemble process can perform a large number of complex
operations without creating a new layer at each step, resulting in a fast
process. In addition, S2I scripts can be written to re-use artifacts stored in a
previous version of the application image, rather than having to download or
build them each time the build is run.

Patchability:: S2I allows you to rebuild the application consistently if an
underlying image needs a patch due to a security issue.

Operational efficiency:: By restricting build operations instead of allowing
arbitrary actions, as a *_Dockerfile_* would allow, the PaaS operator can avoid
accidental or intentional abuses of the build system.

Operational security:: Building an arbitrary *_Dockerfile_* exposes the host
system to root privilege escalation. This can be exploited by a malicious user
because the entire Docker build process is run as a user with Docker privileges.
S2I restricts the operations performed as a root user and can run the scripts
as a non-root user.

User efficiency:: S2I prevents developers from performing arbitrary `yum
install` type operations, which could slow down development iteration, during
their application build.

Ecosystem:: S2I encourages a shared ecosystem of images where you can leverage
best practices for your applications.

Reproducibility:: Produced images can include all inputs including specific versions
of build tools and dependencies. This ensures that the image can be reproduced
precisely.

[id="build-strategy-custom-build_{context}"]
= Custom build

The Custom build strategy allows developers to define a specific builder image
responsible for the entire build process. Using your own builder image allows
you to customize your build process.

A Custom builder image is a plain Docker-formatted container image embedded with
build process logic, for example for building RPMs or base images.

Custom builds run with a very high level of privilege and are not available to
users by default. Only users who can be trusted with cluster administration
permissions should be granted access to run custom builds.
