<2> This is a required directory. All {walkthrough-name}s are defined under `walkthroughs`.

<3> The directory name of a {walkthrough-name}. This is also displayed in the URL of {webapp}.

<4> All images for the {walkthrough-name}.

<5> *walkthrough.adoc* is where the content of the {walkthrough-name} is written in Asciidoc format.

<6> *walkthrough.json* is the manifest file of the {walkthrough-name} where you can define extra dependencies.
